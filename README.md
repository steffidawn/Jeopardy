### Day 2 & 3: Writing JavaScript Logic & Basic Layout with HTML and CSS

* Created basic layout with HTML and CSS:
  * Start button to begin game
  * Game board grid for clues

* Built API logic in JavaScript to retrieve all data required for each clue to be shows on the game board.

* Set up divs that will reveal clues and answers.


### Day 4 & 5: Styling and building on/revising exising JavaScript Logic 

* Adjusted layout/styling of the game:
  * Added more CSS via font styling, background colors, and images.

* Added more functionality with JavaScript:
  * Buzzer
  * Button to return back to game
  * End Game logic 

### Day 6 & 7: Finish styling 

* Corrected position of divs.
* Touched up colors and font styling so that all pages match.
* Revised any JavaScript logic that needed to be adjusted.
* Cleaned up code by removing any unnecessary classes/ids/elements.

## Next Steps:

1. Improve end game logic to feature a modal instead of an alert box.
2. Add 2 levels to mimic the true Jeopardy game play - 1 regular round and 1 Double Jeopardy round.
3. Add Daily Doubles to the game board.
4. Add sound effects.
5. Expand the number of categories (pulled from the API I used) and randomize the categories and their clues every time a new game is started.
